\section{Motivation}

One of the largest problems in medical image processing is the lack of annotated data. To function 
robustly and to show their generalizability potential, deep learning networks require a large 
amount of annotated images. However, 

% https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1361841517301135?via%3Dihub

annotating medical imaging is often time-consuming, precise work. There is a need to improve the 
data-efficiency and robustness of deep learning networks trained on smaller datasets. Furthermore, 
there is a need to make the labeling process faster to save experts' time. This paper represents a 
step towards both of those goals. First, we present a method which uses self-supervised learning 
to extract salient information from \textit{unlabeled} images which can then be used to more 
easily train a deep learning network on a more limited dataset of \textit{labeled} images.

% cite some self-supervised paper

Secondly, we evaluate this on an object detection dataset. In terms of labeling complexity, it is 
simpler and quicker to label a dataset with bounding boxes than to label each instance as is 
needed for semantic segmentation. In a lot of medical imaging tasks, a precise semantic 
segmentation map is not required, and a bounding box communicates sufficient information for 
further diagnosis, treatment or research on a given image. By improving data efficiency for 
bounding box labels, we hope to increase their usefulness and thus save time by allowing experts 
to use bounding box labels in place of semantic segmentation maps.

\section{Dataset description and demographics}\label{dataset}

The dataset used in this paper is a dataset of 15,000 labeled chest radiographs called VinDr-CXR, 
described in more detail in \citep{nguyenVinDrCXROpenDataset2021}. While the original dataset 
contains 3,000 additional test images, we were not able to obtain the labels for these images, and 
they were not used in this paper. Each scan of the dataset was labeled by three separate 
radiologists.  The dataset was collected from two major Vietnamese hospitals. 

We chose this dataset as a good indicator of the generalizability of the findings in this paper 
due to several reasons. Firstly, to our knowledge, this is the largest radiograph dataset with 
bounding box labels for each finding. Secondly, having multiple labels for each image allows us to 
perform a large variety of statistical evaluation methods, such as comparing the inter-observer 
variability. Having multiple labels also allows us to use automatic methods to find a concensus 
between them, possibly leading to less noisy annotations.

\subsection{Data preparation}

Each DICOM image from the dataset was resized to a resolution of 512 $\times$ 512 pixels. We 
discard all examples for which there is no anomaly found (examples labeled as "no finding"). After 
discarding, we are left with a total of 4,394 images. We randomly split this dataset into a 
training set (70\%, 3075 images), validation set (10\%, 440 images) and a test set (20\%, 878 
images). The training set was used to train the models, the validation set was used to tune the 
model hyperparameters and determine when to stop training, and the test set is used for final 
evaluation. The model did not have access to the test set during training.

The original dataset differentiates 14 different classes, one of which is the "no finding" class. 
We discard this class, resulting in 13 possible class labels. Each image can have one or more 
labels from multiple experts, and these labels often overlap. To produce the least noisy labels, 
we fused overlapping labels from multiple experts into one label by finding an average rectangle 
of several overlapping rectanges. To determine if two rectangles are overlapping, an intersection-over-union 
(IoU) threshold of 20\% is used. A rectangle ${R_i}$ is defined by its top-left corner 
$(X_{i1}, Y_{i1})$ and its bottom-right corner $(X_{i2}, Y_{i2})$. An average rectangle $\bar{R}$ 
defined by coordinates $(\bar{X_{1}}, \bar{Y_{1}})$ and $(\bar{X_{2}}, \bar{Y_{2}})$ is calculated as follows:

\begin{align}
\bar{X_1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i1}}{N}, \bar{Y_1} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{i1}}{N},\\
\bar{X_2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} X_{i2}}{N}, \bar{Y_2} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N} Y_{i2}}{N} \nonumber
\end{align}

Where $N$ is the number of rectangles to average. This approach is based on weighted boxes fusion 
described in \cite{solovyevWeightedBoxesFusion2021}, but modified such that each bounding box has 
equal weight and confidence since they were manually labeled by an expert. An example of fused 
bounding boxes is shown in \ref{fig:wbf}.

\section{Methods}

The main goal of this paper is to analyze gow self-supervised model pre-training affects data efficiency for object detection in medical images. Therefore, we first train a baseline deep learning model with no pre-traning and on the full labeled traning dataset following a standard approach for this type of problem. This model will be used as a point of comparison to more objectively evaluate the pre-trained models.

To evaluate the pre-training, we randomly split the traning dataset into two separate datasets, a pre-traning and fine-tuning dataset. For the pre-traning dataset we discard all class labels, as this dataset will be used to pre-train the model using self-supervised learning on unlabeled data. The fine-tuning dataset will then be used to fine-tune the pre-trained model using standard supervised learning. We train nine different pre-trained models in total, ranging from 10\% to 90\% of the total training set in the unlabeled pre-train dataset, in increments of 10\%. A summary of our approach is shown in \ref{fig:dataset-split-summary}.

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/dataset-split-summary}
\caption{A summary of our experiments. A percentage of the training dataset is moved to the pre-training dataset and models are pre-trained using the pre-training datasets and then fine tuned with the rest of the training data. The pre-training datasets are unlabeled. A separate baseline model is trained using the full labeled dataset.}
\label{fig:dataset-split-summary}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Baseline model details}

For an objective and fair comparison, we train a baseline model using a standard deep learning-based approach for object detection. We use a Faster R-CNN-based model \citep{DBLP:conf/nips/RenHGS15} with a ResNet50 encoder \citep{He_2016_CVPR}. The model is initialized using pre-trained weights trained on the COCO dataset for 12 epochs, a batch size of 2 and using the SGD optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0002, momentum of 0.9 and a weight decay of 0.0001.

\subsection{Pretraining model details}

The pretraining model we use is a SimCLR-based model \citep{chenSimpleFrameworkContrastive2020} to pre-train a ResNet-50 backbone, the same backbone used in the baseline model. We train the SimCLR model (described later in this section) using the unlabeled pre-training dataset. We then use the pre-trained backbone in the same model as our baseline model and fine-tune the final model on the fine-tuning dataset. The result is a model similar to our backbone model but trained on fewer labeled data.

SimCLR uses contrastive learning where an example image is augmented randomly twice and each augmentation is fed into a separate encoder branch, where the branches use shared weights. The network outputs two feature maps, one for each augmentation. The loss function measures the difference between these two feature maps. The closer the two feature maps are, the lower the loss. This ensures that two augmentations from the same example will produce similar feature maps, thus making the network learn salient features which are invariant to the chosen augmentations.

In our experiments, we use the following augmentations for SimCLR training:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A random crop and resize of the original image by a factor of 0.2 to 1.
\item A random horizontal flip (with a 50\% chance).
\item A random Gaussian blur with $\sigma$ between 0.1 and and 2, and a kernel size of 21.
\item A random amount of Gaussian noise with $\sigma$ being a random number between 12.5\% and 25\% of the mean image pixel value.
\end{enumerate}

In addition, each traning and validation image has histogram normalization applied.

\section{Equations}\label{sec4}

Equations in \LaTeX\ can either be inline or on-a-line by itself (``display equations''). For
inline equations use the \verb+$...$+ commands. E.g.: The equation
$H\psi = E \psi$ is written via the command \verb+$H \psi = E \psi$+.

For display equations (with auto generated equation numbers)
one can use the equation or align environments:
\begin{equation}
\|\tilde{X}(k)\|^2 \leq\frac{\sum\limits_{i=1}^{p}\left\|\tilde{Y}_i(k)\right\|^2+\sum\limits_{j=1}^{q}\left\|\tilde{Z}_j(k)\right\|^2 }{p+q}.\label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{align}
D_\mu &=  \partial_\mu - ig \frac{\lambda^a}{2} A^a_\mu \nonumber \\
F^a_{\mu\nu} &= \partial_\mu A^a_\nu - \partial_\nu A^a_\mu + g f^{abc} A^b_\mu A^a_\nu \label{eq2}
\end{align}
Notice the use of \verb+\nonumber+ in the align environment at the end
of each line, except the last, so as not to produce equation numbers on
lines where no equation numbers are required. The \verb+\label{}+ command
should only be used at the last line of an align environment where
\verb+\nonumber+ is not used.
\begin{equation}
Y_\infty = \left( \frac{m}{\textrm{GeV}} \right)^{-3}
    \left[ 1 + \frac{3 \ln(m/\textrm{GeV})}{15}
    + \frac{\ln(c_2/5)}{15} \right]
\end{equation}
The class file also supports the use of \verb+\mathbb{}+, \verb+\mathscr{}+ and
\verb+\mathcal{}+ commands. As such \verb+\mathbb{R}+, \verb+\mathscr{R}+
and \verb+\mathcal{R}+ produces $\mathbb{R}$, $\mathscr{R}$ and $\mathcal{R}$
respectively (refer Subsubsection~\ref{subsubsec2}).

\section{Tables}\label{sec5}

Tables can be inserted via the normal table and tabular environment. To put
footnotes inside tables you should use \verb+\footnotetext[]{...}+ tag.
The footnote appears just below the table itself (refer Tables~\ref{tab1} and \ref{tab2}). 
For the corresponding footnotemark use \verb+\footnotemark[...]+

\begin{table}[h]

In case of double column layout, tables which do not fit in single column width should be set to full text width. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table}+ environment. Lengthy tables which do not fit in textwidth should be set as rotated table. For this, you need to use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable}+ instead of \verb+\begin{table*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{table*}+ environment. This environment puts tables rotated to single column width. For tables rotated to double column width, use \verb+\begin{sidewaystable*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{sidewaystable*}+.

\section{Figures}\label{sec6}

As per the \LaTeX\ standards you need to use eps images for \LaTeX\ compilation and \verb+pdf/jpg/png+ images for \verb+PDFLaTeX+ compilation. This is one of the major difference between \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+. Each image should be from a single input .eps/vector image file. Avoid using subfigures. The command for inserting images for \LaTeX\ and \verb+PDFLaTeX+ can be generalized. The package used to insert images in \verb+LaTeX/PDFLaTeX+ is the graphicx package. Figures can be inserted via the normal figure environment as shown in the below example:

\end{figure}

In case of double column layout, the above format puts figure captions/images to single column width. To get spanned images, we need to provide \verb+\begin{figure*}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{figure*}+.

For sample purpose, we have included the width of images in the optional argument of \verb+\includegraphics+ tag. Please ignore this. 

\section{Algorithms, Program codes and Listings}\label{sec7}

You may refer above listed package documentations for more details before setting \verb+algorithm+ environment. For program codes, the ``program'' package is required and the command to be used is \verb+\begin{program}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{program}+. A fast exponentiation procedure:

Similarly, for \verb+listings+, use the \verb+listings+ package. \verb+\begin{lstlisting}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{lstlisting}+ is used to set environments similar to \verb+verbatim+ environment. Refer to the \verb+lstlisting+ package documentation for more details.

\section{Cross referencing}\label{sec8}

Environments such as figure, table, equation and align can have a label
declared via the \verb+\label{#label}+ command. For figures and table
environments use the \verb+\label{}+ command inside or just
below the \verb+\caption{}+ command. You can then use the
\verb+\ref{#label}+ command to cross-reference them. As an example, consider
the label declared for Figure~\ref{fig1} which is
\verb+\label{fig1}+. To cross-reference it, use the command 
\verb+Figure \ref{fig1}+, for which it comes up as
``Figure~\ref{fig1}''. 

To reference line numbers in an algorithm, consider the label declared for the line number 2 of Algorithm~\ref{algo1} is \verb+\label{algln2}+. To cross-reference it, use the command \verb+\ref{algln2}+ for which it comes up as line~\ref{algln2} of Algorithm~\ref{algo1}.

\subsection{Details on reference citations}\label{subsec7}

Standard \LaTeX\ permits only numerical citations. To support both numerical and author-year citations this template uses \verb+natbib+ \LaTeX\ package. For style guidance please refer to the template user manual.

Here is an example for \verb+\cite{...}+: \cite{bib1}. Another example for \verb+\citep{...}+: \citep{bib2}. For author-year citation mode, \verb+\cite{...}+ prints Jones et al. (1990) and \verb+\citep{...}+ prints (Jones et al., 1990).

All cited bib entries are printed at the end of this article: \cite{bib3}, \cite{bib4}, \cite{bib5}, \cite{bib6}, \cite{bib7}, \cite{bib8}, \cite{bib9}, \cite{bib10}, \cite{bib11} and \cite{bib12}.

\section{Examples for theorem like environments}\label{sec10}

For theorem like environments, we require \verb+amsthm+ package. There are three types of predefined theorem styles exists---\verb+thmstyleone+, \verb+thmstyletwo+ and \verb+thmstylethree+

Additionally a predefined ``proof'' environment is available: \verb+\begin{proof}+ \verb+...+ \verb+\end{proof}+. This prints a ``Proof'' head in italic font style and the ``body text'' in roman font style with an open square at the end of each proof environment. 

\begin{proof}

\section{Methods}\label{sec11}

Topical subheadings are allowed. Authors must ensure that their Methods section includes adequate experimental and characterization data necessary for others in the field to reproduce their work. Authors are encouraged to include RIIDs where appropriate. 

\textbf{Ethical approval declarations} (only required where applicable) Any article reporting experiment/s carried out on (i)~live vertebrate (or higher invertebrates), (ii)~humans or (iii)~human samples must include an unambiguous statement within the methods section that meets the following requirements: 

\begin{enumerate}[1.]
\item Approval: a statement which confirms that all experimental protocols were approved by a named institutional and/or licensing committee. Please identify the approving body in the methods section

\item Accordance: a statement explicitly saying that the methods were carried out in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations

\item Informed consent (for experiments involving humans or human tissue samples): include a statement confirming that informed consent was obtained from all participants and/or their legal guardian/s
\end{enumerate}

If your manuscript includes potentially identifying patient/participant information, or if it describes human transplantation research, or if it reports results of a clinical trial then  additional information will be required. Please visit (\url{https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial-policies}) for Nature Portfolio journals, (\url{https://www.springer.com/gp/authors-editors/journal-author/journal-author-helpdesk/publishing-ethics/14214}) for Springer Nature journals, or (\url{https://www.biomedcentral.com/getpublished/editorial-policies\#ethics+and+consent}) for BMC.

\section{Discussion}\label{sec12}

Discussions should be brief and focused. In some disciplines use of Discussion or `Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Some journals prefer a section `Results and Discussion' followed by a section `Conclusion'. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements. 

\section{Conclusion}\label{sec13}

Conclusions may be used to restate your hypothesis or research question, restate your major findings, explain the relevance and the added value of your work, highlight any limitations of your study, describe future directions for research and recommendations. 

In some disciplines use of Discussion or 'Conclusion' is interchangeable. It is not mandatory to use both. Please refer to Journal-level guidance for any specific requirements.
